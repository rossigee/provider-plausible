# Targets

# run `make submodules` after cloning the repository for the first time.
submodules:
	@git submodule sync
	@git submodule update --init --recursive

# NOTE: the build submodule currently overrides XDG_CACHE_HOME in order to
# force the Helm 3 to use the .work/helm directory. This causes Go on Linux
# machines to use that directory as the build cache as well. We should adjust
# this behavior in the build submodule because it is also causing Linux users
# to duplicate their build cache, but for now we just make it easier to identify
# its location in CI so that we cache between builds.
go.cachedir:
	@go env GOCACHE

# Use the default generate targets from build system
# The build system already handles code generation properly

# NOTE: we must ensure up is installed in tool cache prior to build as including the k8s_tools
# machinery prior to the xpkg machinery sets UP to point to tool cache.

# This is for running out-of-cluster locally, and is for convenience. Running
